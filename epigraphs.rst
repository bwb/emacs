   Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not
   actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is
   it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use
   mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science
   is like engineering; it is all about getting something to do
   something, rather than just dealing with abstractions, as in the
   pre-Smith geology

   The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of
   collection.
