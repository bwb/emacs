   Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not
   actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is
   it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use
   mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science
   is like engineering; it is all about getting something to do
   something, rather than just dealing with abstractions, as in the
   pre-Smith geology.

   The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of
   collection.

   1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and
      ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
   2. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and
      thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can
      probably get a career in it.
   3. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the
      natural order of things.

   -- Douglas Adams, "The Salmon of Doubt"
